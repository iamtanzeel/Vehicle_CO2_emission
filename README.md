# Vehicle_CO2_emission


## About the project:
The project is to determine the amount of CO2 emitted by the vehicle based on the inputs such as the mileage, fuel type and transmission type.

## CO2 Emission: 
Motor vehicle exhausts also produce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The main greenhouse gas produced by vehicles is carbon dioxide (CO2), but they also produce nitrous oxide and methane.
Motor vehicles remain a major source of air pollutants, especially where there is more traffic. However, many vehicles have cleaner exhausts that produce less air pollutants than others.

## Dataset:
The dataset is availble on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles

This dataset captures the details of how CO2 emissions by a vehicle can vary with the different features. 
The dataset has been taken from Canada Government official open data website. This is a compiled version. This contains data over a period of 7 years.
There are few abbreviations that has been used to describe the features. I am listing them out here. The same can be found in the Data Description sheet.

Model
4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive

AWD = All-wheel drive

FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle

SWB = Short wheelbase

LWB = Long wheelbase

EWB = Extended wheelbase


Transmission

A = Automatic

AM = Automated manual

AS = Automatic with select shift

AV = Continuously variable

M = Manual

3 - 10 = Number of gears

Fuel type

X = Regular gasoline

Z = Premium gasoline

D = Diesel

E = Ethanol (E85)

N = Natural gas

Fuel Consumption
City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per gallon (mpg)


CO2 Emissions
The tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving
